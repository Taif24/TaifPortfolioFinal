											<p>My second virtual reality project was a group project that we completed in one week. The project provided an interactive experience where users could explore Saudi Arabia’s past, present, and future through a time-traveling train. The project was designed in Unity, and some of the assets were created using Maya.</p>

											<p>The first game I created took one week to develop. The game revolves around a character who must break a curse on their island by collecting the spirits of the forest. The core gameplay focuses on gathering these spirits. It also features the first character I designed in Maya, which is the spirits. The game was developed using Unity.</p>

											<p>The second game I worked on was a group project, completed in one week. The game follows a robot in a high-tech city that has been overrun by a virus, causing glitches and destruction. As the sole survivor, the robot must defeat enemies and collect the core elements to save the city before the glitches consume it. All props were designed in Maya, and the game was developed using Unity.</p>

											<p>I designed this stadium to celebrate Saudi Arabia hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup. I incorporated purple as a primary color, symbolizing Saudi Arabia through the lavender shade. The model was created in Maya, with texturing and coloring done in Substance Painter.</p>

											<p>The first house I designed in Maya went through three stages: exterior design, interior design, and texturing. All aspects, including modeling, coloring, and texturing, were created entirely in Maya. I also won first place for the best interior design.</p>
